# ACTesting: Automated Cross-modal Testing Method of Text-to-Image Software

## Overview

This project aims to build a new Tool for testing T2I software generation results.  ACTesting is an Automated Cross-modal Testing Method of Text-to-Image software, the first testing method designed specifically for T2I software. We construct test samples based on entities and relationship triples following the fundamental principle of maintaining consistency in the semantic information to overcome the cross-modal matching challenges. To address the issue of testing oracle scarcity, we first design the metamorphic relation for T2I software and implement three types of mutation operators guided by adaptability density.
